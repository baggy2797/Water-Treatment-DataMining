I have used Google Colaboratory Notebook in order to execute the Code and upload the .ipynb and the ascii files as the output of the assignment.

I have written my code in Python.

STEPS :

1 ]    In order to run the code on the Colaboratory upload the notebook and the dataset with .data as the extension.

2 ]    Use the run button and run all the cells from the notebook.

3 ]    I have placed all the used packages directly extended via the notebook.
